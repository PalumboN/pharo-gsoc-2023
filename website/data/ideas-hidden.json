    "description": "We want to implement a water quality sensor platform for the lake of Gui\u00e8rs in Senegal with Pharo-IoT. The data will be collected by probes. The objective is to develop tools to interact on the fly on how data is collected, aggregated and stored, as the needs of the local population evolve to provide them with co-constructed indicators on water quality.",
