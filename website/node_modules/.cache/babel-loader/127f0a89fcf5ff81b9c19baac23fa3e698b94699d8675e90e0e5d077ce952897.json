You can find the email addresses of all our mentors in the <a href={ROUTES.IDEAS}>list of project ideas</a>. Talk to them about the complexity and skills required for the different projects.</li>\n      <li>During the selection process, we will pay special attention to your experience with OOP and knowledge of Pharo. If you are new to Pharo, use the time you have before selection to enrich your portfolio. Read several chapters of <a href=\"https://books.pharo.org/pharo-by-example9/\">Pharo by Example book</a> or take the <a href=\"https://mooc.pharo.org/\">Pharo MOOC</a> - videos, exercises, challenges, and mini-projects. But most importantly, write something cool in Pharo and put it on your GitHub. It can be a simple project or exercise. If we see that you can write code and do it well, this will increase your chances of being accepted.</li>\n      <li>If you have a personal technical blog, this will also increase your chances. If you don’t have it, now is an excellent time to start. Write about the things you learn or the projects you work on. For example, you can write about your experience learning Pharo and describe some simple project you implemented (such as linear regression, tic-tac-toe game, or linked list).</li>\n      <li>Interact with Pharo Community. Ask and answer questions on Discord, join our <a href=\"https://pharo.org/community\">mailing lists</a>. Participate in our <a href=\"https://pharo.org/contribute-events\">monthly sprints</a>. Try fixing some bugs, open some relevant issues, suggest changes or additional features (see Pharo's <a href=\"https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/issues\">issue tracker</a>). The better the contributions, the better are the chances of selection.</li>\n      <li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Start working on your project proposal (see the section on how to apply) as soon as possible. The proposal is an extensive and detailed document that has to be carefully and diligently prepared. So contact the mentors right away and start working on your proposal.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p><b>HINT:</b> If you have a project idea that is not on the Idea List, negotiate it with the community, it may be of interest, and mentors might be found.</p>\n\n    <h3>4.1. Things to remember</h3>\n\n    <p>Although we pay great attention to your technical skills, <b>communication skills are way more important</b>. We must see that you can work remotely, be active on forums, not be afraid to ask questions or express your opinion. Students who are active in our communication channels have a higher chance of being selected.</p>\n\n    <p>Be proactive - <b>do not wait to be told what to do</b>. Your mentors are here to answer your questions, help you get unstuck, make sure that you are on track. But they will not give you step-by-step instructions or make decisions for you. Show us that you can take the initiative in your own hands and work independently even when your mentors are not there to help you (although we will try to make sure that they always are). Show us that you have been working on some projects outside the classroom, especially projects that you did \"for fun\".</p>\n\n    <h2>5. How to apply?</h2>\n\n    <p>To <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started\">apply for Google Summer of Code</a>, you must:</p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>Accept the terms of the Student Participant Agreement</li>\n      <li>Submit a Project Proposal</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <p><b>The application period is <code>March 20, 18:00 UTC - April 4, 18:00 UTC</code></b>. Be sure to check the complete <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline\">timeline of Google Summer of Code 2023</a>.</p>\n\n    <h3>5.1. Writing a project proposal</h3>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Take a look at the <a href={ROUTES.IDEAS}>list of ideas</a> proposed by the Pharo Community. You can take any one of these topics or suggest your own. However, you must make sure that:</li>\n      <ul>\n        <li>There are at least two mentors in the community willing to work with you on the proposed project. So get in touch with mentors early and discuss your ideas with them.</li>\n        <li>The proposed project is interesting and relevant to the community. All projects in our list of ideas were selected by the community and represent something we want to have in Pharo. So if you propose your own project, make sure to discuss your idea on the mailing list and Discord and see if people need it.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <li>Follow the <a href=\"https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal#the-basics\">instructions for writing a project proposal</a>.</li>\n      <li>As an example, take a look at <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oAmutbsbOCHLvdkQleVDvYtHZs9OxhMR?usp=sharing\">project proposals that were accepted by Pharo Consortium in previous years</a>.</li>\n      <li>Don’t write your project proposal alone. As soon as you have the first draft (no matter how bad you think it is), send it to the mentors and preferably to the mailing list and the dedicated channel on Discord. High-quality proposals are written iteratively: <i>draft - get feedback - update - get feedback - update ...</i></li>\n      <li>Submit your proposal early; you can update your draft on the GSoC website later. But be careful not to miss the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline\">deadline</a>.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>6. What will be the main responsibilities of accepted students?</h2>\n\n    <p>Accepted students have the responsibilities to:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Follow the plan declared in your project proposal.</li>\n      <li>Submit daily reports of your progress to our mailing list (what did you do today, what do you plan to do tomorrow, what problems or questions do you have).</li>\n      <li>Write a blog post every week to document your work and report your progress to the community.</li>\n      <li>Regularly communicate with your mentors and the broader community.</li>\n      <li>Ask for help when something is preventing you from achieving a goal.</li>\n      <li>Re-evaluate work scope when you are significantly ahead of expectations.</li>\n      <li>Inform when work capacity will be reduced, as early as possible (e.g., family, health, other work).</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>Read more about <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/responsibilities\">student responsibilities</a>.</p>\n\n    <h2>7.
